# Bootstrap-Carosel-with-cat-website

In this exercise I took the home page of my cat website and converted 
it into a mobile first implementation using bootstrap and features a 
customized "hero-sized" carosel with pictures of my cats. Appoligize in 
advance for the broken link tabs to the other pages, this was just a quick
implementation that shows a variation on the standard carosel, and in retrospect
the original carosel image size probably looked better.
